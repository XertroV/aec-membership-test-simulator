To: Mr Tom Rogers, Australian Electoral Commissioner.

This is a request to review the decision to deregister "VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!" (Flux) under s137(6) of the Electoral Act made on the 24th of March 2022.

**My statement to the commission**

I invite the commission, Mr Rogers along with Justice Kelly and Dr Gruen, to consider the following hypothetical case regarding the AEC's method for validating that a party meets the requirements of the Electoral Act:

Consider a party with 9,000 members, and let's say that half of those members (4,500) are validatable as electors, and a further 60% of those members (2,700) will respond "yes" to an AEC request for membership confirmation.

That is: 4,500 members are not validatable as electors, and a further 1,800 would deny membership if asked by the AEC. The remaining 2,700 are legitimate.

Justice Kenny, as I'm sure you're aware, the Electoral Act (EA) specifies that an eligible party requires at least 1,500 members. In your legal opinion, is 2,700 more than 1,500?

I assume that you know that it is. I anticipate that you would agree that, at this point and all else being equal, this hypothetical party is eligible under the EA. At the very least, we do not have a reason to conclude that the party is ineligible.

Dr Gruen, are you a man dedicated to facts and truth or falsehoods and political agendas? I'm sure that, as a statistician, you appreciate that if a statistical test has a predetermined outcome, then that test is not reliable. If you had a blood sample processed by a doctor, would you accept the results if that doctor gave them to you *before* the blood sample was taken?

So, Dr Gruen, please consider our hypothetical case.
Given that this hypothetical party is eligible under the EA, how would it fair when tested using the AEC's methodology?
Given that this party cannot determine which of the 4,500 validatable members will respond "yes" or "no", if a subset of members are selected at random, then each member will deny membership with a probability of 0.6 (60%).
Of course, we know this because 2,700 / (2,700 + 1,800) = 0.6.

Let us assume that this hypothetical party randomly selects 1,650 validatable members from its pool of 4,500.
Dr Gruen, I hope that you find this a reasonable course of action for the party to take.

Dr Gruen, would you agree that the accuracy of a statistical method is how often it results in true positives and true negatives?
That is: if a method results in false positives and false negatives some of the time, it cannot have 100% accuracy.
If there exists some case where the method *will always* result in false negatives, then we can conclude that such a method is *inaccurate*, yes?

I invite you, Dr Gruen, to please calculate the probability that this hypothetical party passes the AEC's membership testing methodology -- that methodology endorsed by your bureau.
You may assume that no members are filtered out, i.e., that during the AEC's validation of the membership list no electors are excluded for being duplicates, or deceased, or unmatchable against the electoral roll, etc.

All the information required for such a calculation is specified above.

Mr Rogers, while Dr Gruen is calculating that probability, let us discuss [something you wrote recently](https://aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/corporate-plan/index.htm):

> The AEC’s values of electoral integrity through agility, professionalism and quality underpin everything we do [...]

I also believe that integrity is important.
Integrity is necessary for a system (or a person) to remain robust.
Integrity is a major difference between 'stable and enduring', and 'compromised and corrupted'.
When integrity fails, good systems become rotten.
Do you not agree?

It is to your integrity, and the integrity of Justice Kelly and Dr Gruen, too, that I make this appeal.
I am fully aware that you are free to decide whatever you wish -- The Electoral Act is written so that you are free to do whatever you wish.

I ask you this: if the AEC and the ABS were wrong about the AEC's testing methodology, how would you know?
Surely you realize that this is possible -- we are all fallible, and our ideas are fallible.

Justice Kelly and Dr Gruen, do you also realize this?
That no human, and no human institution, is infallible?

Mr Rogers, if it is possible to be wrong, what does it mean to have integrity in the face of being wrong?
Is it the path of honesty and truth-seeking, or is it the path of authority, baseless claims, and dismissal?

Now, let us return to the matter of the accuracy of the AEC's testing methodology.
Dr Gruen, are you done calculating those probabilities?
Let us compare answers.

Here is mine with 95% confidence intervals: the probability that our hypothetical party passes the AEC's testing method is 0.0020% ± 0.0012%.
The mean membership denials via the AEC's test is 23.998 ± 0.010 (out of 60 successful contacts).
The standard deviation of that distribution is 3.765 ± 0.007.
The SEM for these results is 0.005.

Dr Gruen, would you consider a statistical method accurate if the probability of it failing is 99.9980% ± 0.0012%?
Would you consider that, in this case, the statistical method is *predetermined* in its outcome?

Justice Kelly, do you consider it appropriate for an important legal institution to use a method that fails 99% of the time?
What would our society be like if the courts had this kind of failure rate for certain cases?

Mr Rogers, do you think that a test which, in some cases, has a 99% failure rate, should be used by someone who values integrity and quality?
Do you think that such a test is "rational, fair and practical in all the circumstances"? [1]

<span></span>[1]: <https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registration_Decisions/2021/notice-of-decision-with-reasons-SUPA.pdf>

Dr Gruen, do you think that a test that is sometimes &lt; 1% accurate is "rational, fair and practical in all the circumstances"?

Justice Kelly, do you think that, when a citizen appeals to a judicial process of their country's legal institutions, they deserve the right to be taken seriously?
That they deserve the right to present their case and, if it is supported by the facts, to have an injustice undone?
Is that not one of the primary values of judicial processes and the courts?
To safeguard citizenry from injustices?
To undo decisions that would otherwise be mistakes?
Is that not something that the integrity of our legal institutions depends on?

If a citizen petitions an institution via a judicial process, and proves their case with mathematics and evidence, what are they to do if that is not enough?
If that institution is unconvinced by facts and evidence, how can a citizen have confidence in their legal system?

Moreover, if judicial processes ignore facts and evidence, are those processes serving their purpose -- error correction?
Is that not what judicial processes are about: righting wrongs, undoing mistakes, preventing mistakes, and so on?
What are citizens to do when judicial processes ignore facts and evidence?

Mr Rogers, I cannot force you to change your mind about anything, that is up to you.

I can present you with this case, though.
Perhaps you (along with Justice Kelly and Dr Gruen) have guessed that the hypothetical party was not so hypothetical after all.
The case that we examined is spitting distance from Flux's second membership test (Feb/March 2022).
There is at least one major difference -- in the hypothetical case, the party selected members randomly; in Flux's case, the AEC selected those members for us from the top of the list of 4,680 members that Flux submitted.
That list was alphabetical, so the AEC only sampled from members whose first name started with one of A through G.

Dr Gruen, in such a case, in your expert opinion, which of these should we believe true:
* That Flux has fewer than 1,500 members; or
* That Flux has fewer than 1,500 members whose first name starts with one of A through G?

If a party has 1,000 (~1586 * 29/(17+29)) members whose first name starts with one of A through G, how many members whose names starts with one of H through Z do we expect that party to have?

The point of this argument is not that Flux has sufficient members to satisfy the electoral act.
The point of this argument is that the AEC's method is flawed.
It is inaccurate, it is unreliable, it is unfair, and it is unsuitable -- at least in this case.

<!-- Dr Gruen, what is the chance that a political party only has members whose names start with A-G?
If 63% (~29/(17+29)) of a population *sample* (n=1,586) meet some criterion, and that *sample* have first names starting with A-G only, then:
- Given that we have no reason to think that the population has an unusual distribution of first letters of first names, how big is the full population? (What is N?)
- Given that 63% of the sample (n=1,586) met some criterion, what is your estimate of the size of the subset of N which meets that criterion? -->

I am not asking that the commission believe *me*, I am asking the commission to believe *facts and evidence*.

Justice Kelly, I will ask you again, does a citizen deserve the right to present their case via a judicial process and, if it is supported by the facts, to have an injustice undone?
I hope that your answer is the same in this case as it would have been for all other cases that you have presided over as a Judge of the Court.

The above is sufficient to conclude that Flux was wrongfully deregistered.
It was wrongful because, regardless of whether Flux should be deregistered or not, the AEC's method is not good enough to produce an accurate result in this case.
It is not my place to tell you what should be done instead, I can only demonstrate to you that the current method is predetermined in Flux's case, as it results in a false negative with probability 0.999978 ± 0.000013.
(These numbers differ slightly from those above because they are calculated based on Flux's second test specifically, rather than the hypothetical case from earlier.)

Mr Rogers, Justice Kelly, and Dr Gruen: perhaps this is not enough to convince that there is perhaps some problems with the AEC's methodology.
The only other thing I can do is present you with a statistical analysis of the method -- covering this problem and others, both historical and on-going.
I suppose that it is most relevant for Dr Gruen, since he is the only one I can reasonably expect to have the knowledge of statistics necessary to judge the analysis.
To me knowledge, this is the first third party review of the AEC's methodology.
If there has been a third party review, I think that it is reasonable for the commission to provide it (without an FOI request).

After I sign off, you will find supporting graphs of the Probability Mass Functions comprising the statistical analysis from which my above results were drawn.
Following that, the review of the method.
Please consider these as part of this submission.

There is only one thing that I ask -- besides that this matter is taken seriously.
If the commission resolves to affirm the decision to deregister Flux under s137(6) of the EA, please tell me: if *this* was not enough to convince you that there are problems with the testing method, what would have?
Is there *anything* that would have convinced you?

Mr Rogers, I leave it to you as the accountable authority of the Australian Electoral Commission, along with Justice Kelly and Dr Gruen, to uphold "[the] AEC’s values of electoral integrity through agility, professionalism and quality [...]".

Max.
